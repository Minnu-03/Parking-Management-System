# Parking-Management-System


Inefficient management of parking facilities poses challenges in tracking vehicle entry and exit, as well as monitoring parking lot occupancy. The Parking Management System addresses these shortcomings by offering a sophisticated application designed to streamline the management of vehicle records within parking facilities. This system tracks the entry and exit of cars, maintains a listing of vehicles within the parking lot, and calculates the cost per vehicle based on duration of stay. Implemented in Java, the system leverages the language's versatility and compatibility with various databases, including MySQL. This enables seamless integration with Database Management Systems, ensuring the secure and efficient storage of parking-related data. Its user-friendly interface and adaptable design make parking hassle-free for both administrators and users, enhancing convenience and efficiency.
